Rider-Waite Tarot has set the standard for hundreds of other tarot decks, which follow the archetypal images created by Pamela Colman Smith in 1909under the direction of Arthur Edward Waite. This edition includes Smith's original hand drawn titles."A unique feature of the Rider-Waite deck, and one of the of the principal reasons for its enduring popularity, is that all of the cards, including the Minor Arcana, depict full scenes with figures and symbols. Prior to the Rider-Waite Tarot, the pip cards of almost all tarot decks were marked only with the arrangement of the suit signs -- swords, wands, cups, and coins, or pentacles. The pictorial i

The Rider Tarot Deck by Arthur Edward Waite,Pamela Colman Smith Book Review

Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Heavy, thick, high quality (that's what she said)
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2018
Review: These cards are high quality. I love the thickness of the stock and the vibrant old, original artwork. Kind of cool knowing these are printed in Italy, so you aren't getting a product from a company that's only doing its best to push for bigger profit margins. The worst part about these cards is my newly revealed dubious future.

Title: This was my first deck purchase, and I was highly disappointed...
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2017
Review: This was my first deck purchase, and I was highly disappointed. More than a quarter of my deck are cut wrong therefore some images are cut off. Even my box that was in a shrink wrap, had a flap torn off of it. Other than these issues the cards are a decent thickness and have lovely images and color.

Title: Inaccurate negative reviews imo
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2017
Review: I'm not sure why some people are knocking this deck. The cards aren't THE thickest, but they're absolutely functional and sturdy. Like a standard playing card type thickness. The instruction booklet is 30some totally legible pages long and is a nice quick description of use and contents. The negative reviews made me unnecessarily hesitant to order this deck.

Title: Ignore the Book; Best to Look up Meanings
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2018
Review: I'm not the most advanced tarot reader myself. In fact, I would still consider myself a beginner. Despite this, I still couldn't help but feel the explanations in the book were a bit dissapointing. I found myself finding much more valuable information from simply googling the cards. I know the booklets are small, but I don't believe that means they should be so.. lackluster? I have had tarot decks with small books with wonderful explanations before (deviant moon and native america).
I mainly purchased the official deck because I was having trouble with my readings and felt like the original artwork would be the easiest for me to understand and hold the most power. Well, some of the interpretations sort of conflict with what I have learned so far. This should be the most accurate deck out there.
I had a rider waite before just like this with the original art but it was slightly different version or remastered.. I remember that book not leaving so much to be desired... The interpretations in the book don't seem to coincide with ones from my other tarot or information online. A lot of it is also too specific.
Here is one example.. the two of pentacles: "But it is also read as news and messages in writing such as, obstacles, agitation, trouble, and embroilment."
I thought this was a positive card about balancing the day to day duties in one's life successfully or adapting to change.. Reversed it states it has to do with handwriting and exchange of letters. I don't see what that has to do with the card. I am not an expert myself, but I still couldn't help but feel like the book was lacking. Half the fun to me is reading the book that came with it.
The major arcana, usually the most interesting cards or the ones that indicate the most change are very basic... Meanings just state a bunch of adjectives seperated by commas..

Title: Pretty sure these are fakes
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2018
Review: The coloring was WAY off on these cards. Including the backs. The box you get is also not the box advertised. These are not at all from US Games. Be wary of buying them. I returned mine and bought the real deal from my local metaphysical shop.

Review: Stop writing fake reviews this is the real deal you all are posting knock offs from other sellers! These are the best cards I got and a great size and sturdy cards! :) literally nothing wrong with them :) I ALREADY HAD THEM SINCE FEB 20 2021! I HAD KNOCK OFF BEFORE THIS FROM A DIFFERENT SELLER. I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE I BOUGHT SOME FOR MY FRIEND FIRST THEN FOR MYSELF! :)

Title: Do yourself a favor, read and heed the one-star reviews!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2016
Review: I've been dabbling around with the tarot for about 30 years. Had several standard Rider-Waite decks during that time..they are basically the go-to for learning tarot. Whether you continue to read with them after learning is personal choice, but the standard Rider-Waite is the best tool with which to learn. My old decks were in storage and disappeared, so I needed new ones when I got this most recent urge to take up tarot again.

Generally speaking the coloring on the standard Rider-Waite from U.S. Games has always been a bit garish, but not offensively so, and you get used to it. You might even come to prefer it (I did), which is why I decided to buy this deck.

Stupidly, I did not heed the warnings of the other one-star reviews with regards to the coloration of the current printing of the standard Rider Waite. This edition or whatever you want to call it is really, truly, fantastically horrible. The blues are particularly, offensively bright, distracting, and artificial. These cards are so ugly and weird-looking I can't even begin to contemplate trying to work with them. The woman in the Star trump looks like the old timey wrestler Dusty Rhodes, with his albino-blonde hair and orange spray tan. Just Plain Wrong.

When I opened the shipping box the outer box the cards came in had no plastic on it, and had obviously already been opened, although the cards inside were shrink-wrapped in plastic. And to be clear, I did have to take the plastic off the actual deck to get to the true weirdness and ugliness inside, because the top card that shows through the deck shrink-wrap (The Magician) has only very little blue in it and none of the other truly odd coloring. That card (and that card alone) is relatively normal-looking. So when I took the deck out of the box, before opening the shrink-wrap and looking at the other cards, I assumed I'd gotten a satisfactory deck and the one-star reviews were probably aberrations. Not so!

Bottom line: do yourself a favor and don't buy these, unless you want to pay five bucks return shipping for the privilege of abusing your retinas.

A good alternative is the regular size Smith-Waite Centennial deck, although the coloring isn't as clear for beginners. Watch out for size, though...the Centennials that come in a tin are the same size as playing cards, so if you want a bigger "standard size" tarot deck get the Centennial without a tin.

Another good learning tool is the Giant Rider-Waite. They're very big, almost too big to work with, but they're fun and good for studying the cards. I also rebought a jumbo deck and the coloring on those is fine. The good old standard.

Whatever alternative you choose, just please do yourself a favor and stay away from these! I wish I'd heeded those other one-star reviews. Now I'm out five buck for return shipping. And maybe some eyedrops for retina abrasion.

Title: Nice cards for practicing with
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2017
Review: I bought these to practice with and I like them so far. They are great to use since most tarot authors use this deck for their books. I did, however, receive the package only closed by a rubber band and the cards were out of the cardboard box. The box was bent up but the cards were still in the wrapping thankfully.
